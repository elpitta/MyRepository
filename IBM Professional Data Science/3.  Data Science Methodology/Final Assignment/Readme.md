# Data Science Methodology Final Assignment: Emails

### Q1. Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? 2 marks)

**Ans:**
The topic that I have chosen to apply data science methodology to is **Credit Card**


Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist.

### Q2. Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. **(3 marks)**

You are required to:

Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.
For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?".

**Ans:**
I chose the credit card part, where definid machine learning strategies for the client suitable or not for the service.  So our question here is: 

"Can we predict whether or not a customer is eligible for a line of credit?"  

### Q3. Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. **(5 marks):**

1. Analytic Approach
2. Data Requirements
3. Data Collection
4. Data Understanding and Preparation
5. Modeling and Evaluation

You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.

**Ans:**

1. **Analytic Approach:**

We will use machine learning to answer the question, in this case, the classification model

2. **Data Requirements:**

We will need a date on the bank's customers, delinquent and non-defaulting

3. **Data Collection:**

We will refine our data using statistical and data evaluation techniques.

4. **Data Understanding and Preparation:**

In this step we need to evaluate the different variables of our data to better understand them. For example, we would calculate univariate statistics such as the mean or median and the correlation between the variables. Therefore, we need to assess data quality. In the data preparation phase we have to prepare the data in a specific way depending on the model.


5. **Modeling and Evaluation:**

We will create the classification model and study whether the results obtained are consistent with reality.
